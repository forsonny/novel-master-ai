# Scene Template Importing – Narrative Requirements

This document explains how to drop pre-built outline or scene templates into `.novelmaster/tasks/` and immediately use them as tag contexts (e.g., `outline-act1`, `rev-pass-2`, `beta-reader-a`).

## Why
- Swap outline structures between series without merging JSON by hand
- Share revision checklists with collaborators via version control
- Keep experimental arcs separate from the main manuscript by parking them in template files

## File Naming
- Format: `tasks_<tag>.json` (e.g., `tasks_outline-act2.json`, `tasks_rev-pass.json`)
- Each file must expose **one** tag key matching the filename suffix
- Template tasks follow the standard Novel Master schema (title, description, details, testStrategy, etc.)

## Workflow
1. Drop `tasks_<tag>.json` into `.novelmaster/tasks/`
2. Run `novel-master tags` → imported templates show with `(template)` suffix
3. `novel-master use-tag <tag>` to inspect or copy tasks into your active context
4. Templates are read-only; cloning to a working tag is done with `novel-master add-tag working-tag --copy-from=<tag>`

## Template JSON Skeleton
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "projectName": "Act II Expansion",
    "description": "Beat sheet for act two midpoint pivot",
    "template": true
  },
  "tags": {
    "outline-act2": {
      "meta": {
        "name": "Outline – Act II",
        "description": "Scene beats for escalating tension"
      },
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "Pinch Point – antagonist flex",
          "description": "Show antagonist advantage via public spectacle",
          "details": "POV: MC. Setting: market day. Sensory: smoke + cheering. Stakes: trust in mentor shaken.",
          "testStrategy": "Continuity check against prior antagonist scene"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tips
- Keep IDs small and sequential—Novel Master remaps them when cloning into a working tag
- Include `details` fields with POV/tone cues so templates feel bespoke, not generic
- Attach `testStrategy` guidance (continuity, emotional goal, timeline check) to speed revision passes
