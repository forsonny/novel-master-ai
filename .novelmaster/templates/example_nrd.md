# Novel Requirement Document (NRD) – Example

## 1. Concept
- **Title**: Dawn of Glass
- **Genre**: Science fantasy adventure
- **Themes**: Found family, ecological stewardship, honesty vs control
- **Tone**: Lyrical, hopeful, cinematic set pieces
- **Target Length**: 95,000 words
- **POV Plan**: Two alternating first-person narrators (inventor + smuggler)

## 2. Premise & Hook
When a floating archipelago begins to fracture, a synesthetic inventor and a disgraced smuggler must decode ancient light engines before the islands plunge into the toxic sea.

## 3. Act Structure (Three Acts)
### Act I – Fractures
- Introduce archipelago politics, scarcity of lightfuel
- Meet protagonists separately, foreshadow convergence
- Inciting incident: Light engines malfunction during festival; first island drifts off-course
- Stakes: If the engines fail, the islands sink and release toxic spores

### Act II – Convergence
- Dual investigations reveal sabotage + lost technology
- Midpoint twist: antagonist is secretly preserving islands for a chosen elite
- Emotional beats: growing trust between leads, conflicting loyalties to their families

### Act III – Resonance
- Climax: synchronize rebuilt engines while surviving storm assault
- Dark moment: inventor loses synesthetic sense temporarily; smuggler tempted to trade data for amnesty
- Resolution: islands stabilize but require continuous stewardship; sequel hooks revolve around exporting the tech

## 4. Character Sheets
### Keira Sol (Inventor)
- Motif: tuning forks + color-coded notes
- Goal: stabilize light engines, prove her research is valid
- Internal conflict: guilt over past failure that hurt her sister
- Arc: learns to trust outsiders and relinquish perfectionism

### Mal Rekker (Smuggler)
- Motif: etched compass, coded sea shanties
- Goal: erase criminal record to protect his crew
- Internal conflict: loyalty vs survival instinct
- Arc: chooses transparency over profitable lies

## 5. World Rules
- Islands drift along predictable leyline currents; engines keep them anchored
- Lightfuel harvested from airborne algae fields; requires regular balancing
- Weather patterns shift violently when islands move out of formation
- Communication delays between islands drive rumor and paranoia

## 6. Key Locations
1. **Aurora Dockyards** – Gritty engineering bay where engines are repaired
2. **Verdant Verge** – Lush algae farms shrouded in mist, home to smuggler crew
3. **Glassspire Council Hall** – Political epicenter, opulent yet cracking

## 7. Research Hooks
- Real-world floating city proposals and closed-loop ecosystems
- Bioluminescent algae farming techniques
- Polyphonic singing traditions for Mal’s coded messages

## 8. Deliverables for Parsing
- Generate 6–8 top-level tasks (acts, cross-cutting initiatives)
- Each task should specify POV focus, emotional stakes, sensory motifs, and validation checks (continuity, timeline, word target)
