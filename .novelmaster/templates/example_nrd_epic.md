# NRD – Epic Fantasy Variant

## Series Context
- **Series Name**: Shards of the Silent Court (Book 1 of 3)
- **Planned Word Count**: 130k
- **Magic System**: Contract-based runes fueled by personal memories
- **Viewpoints**: 3 POVs (Queen’s fixer, rebel cartographer, court historian)

## Book-Level Premise
When a dynasty erases rebellious histories by literally consuming memories, three unlikely allies must smuggle a forbidden map that can restore the true past before every archive is devoured.

## POV Breakdown
1. **Iris Vale** – Queen’s fixer
   - Voice: precise, sardonic
   - Motivation: Keep family safe by obeying ruthless queen
   - Secret: secretly hoards stolen memories in illegal glass vials
2. **Tarek Sol** – Rebel cartographer
   - Voice: curious, compassionate
   - Motivation: Preserve cultural songs/maps before they vanish
   - Weakness: panic attacks triggered by blank pages
3. **Edda Rowan** – Court historian
   - Voice: lyrical, haunted
   - Motivation: Document truth even as words fade from page
   - Arc: chooses action over observation

## Act/Arc Outline
### Act I – Masks (30%)
- Court announces mandatory “Remembrance Banquets” (memory consumption rituals)
- Iris tasked with rooting out leak; unknowingly protects Tarek
- Catalyst: Edda discovers map that resists erasure when sung

### Act II – Fractures (50%)
- Trio forms uneasy alliance; plan heist of Memory Vault
- Midpoint revelation: Queen fed false memories; true villain is High Scribe controlling erasures
- Sequence goals:
  - Sneak into Banquet dressed as performers
  - Secure map fragments hidden in stained-glass windows
  - Survive memory dungeon + rescue Iris’s brother

### Act III – Resonance (20%)
- Heist finale intercut with rebellion outside palace
- Iris must sacrifice personal memories to power final rune
- Downbeat twist: restored history sparks civil war, leading to Book 2

## Setting Notes
- City of Halcyon built around mirrored river; reflections store latent memories
- Songs + stained glass act as backup storage for truth
- Memory magic side effects: nosebleeds, partial personality swaps

## Thematic Touchstones
- Truth vs propaganda
- Ethics of forgetfulness
- Found family built on shared stories

## Research Tasks
- Study indigenous cartography using knots/songs
- Examine historical damnatio memoriae practices
- Explore glass-making techniques for color symbolism

## Requested Breakdown
- 9 top-level tasks: 3 per act + 0.5 tasks for cross-cutting initiatives (research, rebellion tracking)
- Each task should include: POV focus, emotional stakes, sensory palette, continuity checkpoints, word-count target
