# NRD – Literary Fiction Variant

## Concept

## Premise & Hook
When a family matriarch dies, three generations of women must come together to sort through her estate—a dilapidated orchard that holds secrets about their family's past and forces them to confront the choices that shaped their lives.

## Act Structure (Three Acts)

### Act I – Gathering (30%)
- Introduce three POV characters: grandmother (Eleanor, 78), mother (Helen, 52), daughter (Claire, 28)
- Inciting incident: Eleanor's death brings the three women together for the first time in years
- Stakes: The orchard must be sold within 90 days, but each woman has different reasons for wanting to keep or sell it
- First plot point: Claire discovers a hidden journal in the orchard's caretaker's cottage

### Act II – Unraveling (50%)
- The journal reveals family secrets that challenge each woman's understanding of her past
- Midpoint revelation: Eleanor wasn't the biological mother of Helen—she adopted her after a family tragedy
- Emotional beats: Growing understanding between generations, healing old wounds, confronting inherited trauma
- Sequence goals:
  - Read through the journal entries chronologically
  - Visit locations mentioned in the journal
  - Confront the truth about their family's history

### Act III – Resolution (20%)
- Climax: The three women must decide together whether to keep the orchard or sell it
- Dark moment: Each woman must choose between honoring the past or moving forward
- Resolution: They decide to restore the orchard together, symbolizing their reconciliation and the continuation of their family legacy

## Character Sheets

### Eleanor (Grandmother, Deceased)
- Voice: (Through journal) Wise, regretful, loving
- Goal: (Posthumous) To help her family understand their history
- Internal conflict: Guilt over secrets kept, love for her family
- Arc: Revealed through journal entries—from young woman to matriarch

### Helen (Mother)
- Voice: Defensive, practical, wounded
- Goal: Sell the orchard and move on from painful memories
- Internal conflict: Anger at Eleanor for keeping secrets vs. love for her mother
- Arc: Learns to forgive and understand her mother's choices

### Claire (Daughter)

## World Rules
- The orchard is a character in itself—its seasons mirror the family's emotional journey
- Time moves both forward (present-day narrative) and backward (journal entries)
- The setting (rural New England) reflects the family's connection to the land
- Weather and natural elements symbolize emotional states
- The past is always present through objects, locations, and memories

## Key Locations
1. **The Orchard** – 50-acre apple orchard, central to the family's history
2. **The Farmhouse** – Three-story Victorian where Eleanor lived, filled with family artifacts
3. **The Caretaker's Cottage** – Small building where the journal is discovered
4. **The Old Town** – Nearby village that holds clues to the family's past

## Research Hooks
- Apple orchard management and seasonal cycles
- Adoption practices and family law in the 1950s-60s
- New England rural life and small-town dynamics
- Grief processing and intergenerational trauma
- Journal writing as a form of legacy preservation

## Deliverables for Parsing
- Generate 8–10 top-level tasks (acts, major emotional beats, generational shifts)
- Each task should specify POV focus, emotional tone, sensory details, and validation checks (timeline consistency across generations, emotional authenticity, word target)
