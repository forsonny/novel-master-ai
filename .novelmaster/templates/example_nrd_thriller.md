# NRD – Psychological Thriller Variant

## Concept
- **Title**: The Echo Protocol
- **Genre**: Psychological thriller
- **Themes**: Identity, surveillance, memory manipulation
- **Tone**: Claustrophobic, paranoid, fast-paced
- **Target Length**: 85,000 words
- **POV Plan**: Single first-person narrator (unreliable)

## Premise & Hook
A cybersecurity analyst discovers that her own memories have been systematically altered by a shadowy organization, and she must race against time to uncover the truth before her next "memory update" erases her completely.

## Act Structure (Three Acts)

### Act I – Discovery (25%)
- Introduce protagonist: Maya Chen, cybersecurity analyst at a tech firm
- Inciting incident: Maya notices discrepancies in her own memories during a routine security audit
- Stakes: If she can't prove her memories were tampered with, she'll be "reset" in 48 hours
- First plot point: Maya discovers a hidden protocol in her company's systems called "Echo Protocol"

### Act II – Investigation (50%)
- Maya goes underground, using her skills to trace the memory manipulation network
- Midpoint twist: Maya realizes she's been working for the organization that's manipulating her
- Emotional beats: Growing paranoia, questioning every memory, losing trust in everyone
- Sequence goals:
  - Hack into the Echo Protocol database
  - Find other "subjects" who've been manipulated
  - Discover the true purpose of the memory manipulation

### Act III – Confrontation (25%)
- Climax: Maya confronts her former boss, who reveals she volunteered for the program
- Dark moment: Maya must choose between restoring her true memories (which include a traumatic past) or accepting the manipulated ones
- Resolution: Maya exposes the organization but chooses to keep some memories suppressed, leading to a morally ambiguous ending

## Character Sheets

### Maya Chen (Protagonist)
- Voice: Technical, analytical, increasingly paranoid
- Goal: Uncover the truth about her memory manipulation
- Internal conflict: Fear of what her true memories contain vs. need for authenticity
- Arc: Learns to accept painful truths over comfortable lies

### Dr. Sarah Kim (Antagonist/Former Boss)
- Voice: Calm, manipulative, paternalistic
- Motivation: Believes memory manipulation helps people live better lives
- Secret: Was Maya's therapist before joining the organization
- Arc: Reveals the complexity of "helping" vs. "controlling"

### Alex Rivera (Ally/Unreliable)
- Voice: Nervous, evasive, sympathetic
- Motivation: Wants to help Maya but is also a subject of manipulation
- Weakness: Can't be trusted because his memories are also compromised
- Arc: Proves trustworthy in the end despite initial deception

## World Rules
- Memory manipulation technology is real and undetectable by standard medical tests
- The organization operates through legitimate tech companies as a front
- Subjects are chosen based on trauma history and professional skills
- Memory "updates" happen every 72 hours unless interrupted
- The technology leaves subtle "echoes" of original memories that can be recovered

## Key Locations
1. **TechCorp Headquarters** – Sleek, modern building where Maya works (and where the manipulation happens)
2. **Underground Safe House** – Abandoned server farm where Maya hides and works
3. **Memory Recovery Lab** – Hidden facility where true memories are stored

## Research Hooks
- Real-world memory manipulation research (optogenetics, false memory implantation)
- Cybersecurity protocols and hacking techniques
- Psychological effects of gaslighting and memory loss
- Surveillance capitalism and data privacy

## Deliverables for Parsing
- Generate 7–9 top-level tasks (acts, major plot beats)
- Each task should specify POV focus, tension level, pacing notes, and validation checks (timeline consistency, memory logic, word target)
