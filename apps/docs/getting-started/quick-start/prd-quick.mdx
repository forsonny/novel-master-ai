# Writing an NRD

An NRD (Novel Requirements Document) is the starting point of every narrative workflow in Novel Master. It defines your story's premise, structure, characters, and world. A clear NRD dramatically improves the quality of your story arcs, chapters, and scenes — so it's worth taking the time to get it right.

<Tip>
You don't need to define your whole novel up front. You can write a focused NRD just for the next act, arc, or chapter you're working on.
</Tip>

<Tip>
You can start with an empty project or you can start with an NRD for a specific story arc on an existing project.
</Tip>

<Tip>
You can add and parse multiple NRDs per project using the --append flag
</Tip>

## What Makes a Good NRD?

- Clear premise — what's the core story concept or logline?
- Character arcs — who are the main characters and how do they change?
- World/lore constraints — what are the rules of your story's world?
- Act structure — how does the story progress (three-act, hero's journey, etc.)?

The more context you give the model, the better the breakdown into story arcs, chapters, and scenes.

## Writing an NRD for Novel Master

<Note>
Two example NRD templates are available in `.novelmaster/templates/`:
- `example_nrd.md` - Simple template for straightforward stories (`.md` recommended for better editor support)
- `example_nrd_epic.md` - Advanced template for complex multi-arc stories with intricate dependencies

**Why `.md`?** While both `.txt` and `.md` work, Markdown files provide syntax highlighting, proper rendering in VS Code/GitHub, and better collaboration through formatted documentation.
</Note>


You can co-write your NRD with an LLM model using the following workflow:

1. **Chat about your story** — explain the premise, characters, and structure you want.
2. **Show an example NRD** — share the example NRD so the model understands the expected format. The example uses formatting that works well with Novel Master's narrative workflows. Following the example will yield better results.
3. **Iterate and refine** — work with the model to shape the draft into a clear and well-structured NRD.

This approach works great in Cursor, or anywhere you use a chat-based LLM.

### Choosing Between Templates

**Use `example_nrd.md` when:**
- Writing straightforward stories
- Working on smaller projects or single-arc narratives
- Story structure is simple and linear

**Use `example_nrd_epic.md` when:**
- Writing complex multi-arc stories
- Need explicit dependency management between storylines
- Want structured guidance on narrative architecture
- Planning a large novel with multiple POVs from scratch

The epic template teaches you to think about:
1. **Narrative decomposition** (WHAT story arcs exist)
2. **Structural organization** (HOW acts and chapters are organized)
3. **Explicit dependencies** (WHAT story beats depend on WHAT)
4. **Chronological ordering** (establish foundation first, then build tension)

<Tip>
For complex stories, using the epic template with a narrative-context-aware AI agent produces the best results because the AI can understand your existing story structure and character arcs.

## Where to Save Your NRD

Place your NRD file in the `.novelmaster/docs` folder in your project.

- You can have **multiple NRDs** per project (e.g., one for main story, one for subplot).
- Name your NRDs clearly so they're easy to reference later.
  - Examples: `main_story_nrd.md`, `character_arc_mina.md`, `worldbuilding_lore.md`
  - Tip: Use `.md` extension for better editor support and syntax highlighting

# Parse your NRD into Tasks

This is where the Novel Master magic begins.

In Cursor's AI chat, instruct the agent to generate story arcs and chapters from your NRD:

```
Please use the novel-master parse-prd command to generate tasks from my NRD. The NRD is located at .novelmaster/docs/<nrd-name>.md.
```

The agent will execute the following command which you can alternatively paste into the CLI:

```bash
novel-master parse-prd .novelmaster/docs/<nrd-name>.md
```

This will:

- Parse your NRD document
- Generate a structured `tasks.json` file with story arcs, chapters, dependencies, priorities, and narrative guidance

Now that you have written and parsed an NRD, you are ready to start expanding chapters into scenes and drafting your manuscript.
