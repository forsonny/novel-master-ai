# Note: Novel Master uses NRD (Novel Requirements Document) instead of PRD

Novel Master has been converted from Task Master and now focuses on novel writing workflows.
Instead of Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), Novel Master uses Novel Requirements Documents (NRDs).

## NRD Templates

For NRD templates, see:
- `assets/templates/example_nrd.md` - Standard NRD template

## Quick Start

1. Copy one of the NRD templates from `assets/templates/` to `.novelmaster/docs/nrd.txt`
2. Fill in your novel's details following the template structure
