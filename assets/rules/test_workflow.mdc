# Novel Master Narrative Testing Workflow

This guide outlines testing strategies for novel writing, focusing on continuity, pacing, character consistency, and narrative quality.

## Types of Narrative Testing

### 1. Continuity Checks

**Purpose**: Ensure consistency across the manuscript (timeline, character details, world rules, plot threads).

**When to Run**:
- After completing each chapter
- Before major revision passes
- When incorporating beta feedback

**What to Check**:
- **Timeline consistency**: Events occur in logical order, dates align
- **Character consistency**: Physical descriptions, personality traits, voice remain consistent
- **World rules**: Magic systems, technology, social structures follow established rules
- **Plot threads**: Subplots are properly introduced, developed, and resolved
- **POV consistency**: Point of view remains clear and consistent within scenes

**Tools**:
```bash
# Use Novel Master to analyze continuity
novel-master analyze-complexity --research

# Review complexity report for continuity issues
novel-master complexity-report
```

**Manual Checks**:
- Search for character names to verify descriptions match
- Review timeline markers (dates, seasons, time references)
- Check worldbuilding details for consistency

### 2. Pacing Analysis

**Purpose**: Ensure the story maintains appropriate rhythm and tension throughout.

**When to Run**:
- After completing each act
- During revision passes
- When beta readers note pacing issues

**What to Analyze**:
- **Chapter length**: Are chapters appropriately sized for the genre?
- **Scene length**: Do scenes feel rushed or dragged out?
- **Tension curve**: Does tension rise and fall appropriately?
- **Pacing density**: Are there appropriate quiet moments between action?
- **Word count distribution**: Are chapters balanced in length?

**Tools**:
```bash
# Generate manuscript with word count tracking
novel-master generate --compile

# Review manuscript summary for pacing metrics
cat .novelmaster/manuscript/draft/manuscript-summary.json
```

**Metrics to Review**:
- Word count per chapter (target vs actual)
- Scene count per chapter
- Tension level distribution (from task metadata)
- Pacing density scores

### 3. Character Consistency Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure characters behave consistently and maintain distinct voices.

**When to Run**:
- After writing scenes with specific characters
- Before revision passes
- When switching between POV characters

**What to Validate**:
- **Voice consistency**: Each POV character has a distinct voice
- **Behavior consistency**: Characters act according to established personality
- **Character arc progression**: Characters grow/change in believable ways
- **Dialogue authenticity**: Each character's speech patterns are distinct
- **Physical descriptions**: Character appearances remain consistent

**Tools**:
```bash
# Use tags to isolate character-specific work
novel-master use-tag pov-protagonist
novel-master list --status=done

# Review character-specific chapters
novel-master show <chapter-id>
```

**Manual Checks**:
- Read all scenes from a single POV character in sequence
- Verify dialogue matches character voice
- Check that character motivations remain consistent

### 4. Timeline Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure events occur in logical sequence and time references are consistent.

**When to Run**:
- After completing each chapter
- When working with multiple timelines
- Before final revision

**What to Verify**:
- **Chronological order**: Events happen in logical sequence
- **Time references**: Days, weeks, months align correctly
- **Seasonal consistency**: Weather, holidays, seasons match timeline
- **Age progression**: Characters age appropriately over time
- **Parallel timelines**: Multiple storylines align correctly

**Tools**:
```bash
# Use timeline tags to organize work
novel-master use-tag timeline-act-1
novel-master list

# Review timeline metadata in tasks
novel-master show <task-id>
```

### 5. POV Balance Analysis

**Purpose**: Ensure point-of-view distribution serves the story effectively.

**When to Run**:
- After completing each act
- When working with multiple POV characters
- During revision passes

**What to Analyze**:
- **POV distribution**: Are POVs balanced appropriately?
- **POV transitions**: Are scene breaks clear when switching POV?
- **POV voice**: Does each POV character have a distinct voice?
- **POV relevance**: Does each POV scene advance the story?

**Tools**:
```bash
# Use POV-specific tags
novel-master use-tag pov-protagonist
novel-master list

# Count POV scenes per character
novel-master list | grep -i "pov"
```

## Testing Workflow

### Per-Chapter Testing

After completing each chapter:

1. **Continuity Check**: Review chapter for consistency with previous chapters
2. **Pacing Review**: Verify chapter length and scene count are appropriate
3. **Character Validation**: Ensure character voices and behaviors are consistent
4. **Timeline Verification**: Confirm time references align with story timeline

### Per-Act Testing

After completing each act:

1. **Full Continuity Audit**: Review entire act for consistency
2. **Pacing Analysis**: Analyze tension curve and pacing density
3. **Character Arc Review**: Verify character development progresses logically
4. **Plot Thread Check**: Ensure all subplots are properly developed

### Pre-Revision Testing

Before major revision passes:

1. **Complete Manuscript Review**: Full continuity, pacing, and character check
2. **Complexity Analysis**: Run `analyze-complexity` to identify issues
3. **Beta Feedback Integration**: Address reader feedback systematically
4. **Final Validation**: One last pass for all narrative elements

## Automated Testing Tools

### Novel Master Commands

```bash
# Analyze narrative complexity
novel-master analyze-complexity --research

# Generate manuscript with metrics
novel-master generate --compile

# Review complexity report
novel-master complexity-report
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Timeline consistency verified
- [ ] Character descriptions match across chapters
- [ ] World rules followed consistently
- [ ] POV transitions are clear
- [ ] Tension curve is appropriate
- [ ] Chapter lengths are balanced
- [ ] Dialogue matches character voice
- [ ] Plot threads are resolved
- [ ] Word count targets met
- [ ] Beta feedback addressed

## Integration with Revision Workflow

Testing should be integrated into the revision process:

1. **Draft Phase**: Basic continuity and pacing checks
2. **Rev-1 (Structural)**: Full continuity audit, pacing analysis
3. **Rev-2 (Line Edits)**: Character voice, dialogue refinement
4. **Beta Feedback**: Address reader-identified issues
5. **Final Pass**: Complete validation before publication

## Best Practices

1. **Test incrementally**: Don't wait until the end to check continuity
2. **Document issues**: Keep notes on continuity problems as you find them
3. **Use tags effectively**: Organize testing by POV, timeline, or revision phase
4. **Leverage AI**: Use Novel Master's analysis tools to identify issues
5. **Trust beta readers**: External feedback is invaluable for narrative testing
