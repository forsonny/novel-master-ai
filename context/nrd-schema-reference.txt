# Novel Requirements Document (NRD) Schema Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for creating Novel Requirements Documents (NRDs) that Novel Master can parse into structured story arcs, chapters, and scenes.

## Required Sections

An NRD must include the following sections for validation to pass:

### 1. Premise

**Required Elements:**

**Example:**
```
**Logline:** A retired detective must solve a murder that mirrors a case from her past, forcing her to confront the truth about her own involvement.

**Premise:** 
When a body is discovered with the same signature as a case Detective Sarah Chen closed twenty years ago, she's pulled back into a world she thought she'd left behind. The victim's connection to her old partner raises questions about the original investigation's integrity. As new evidence emerges, Sarah must choose between protecting her reputation and uncovering the truth, even if it means exposing her own mistakes.
```

## NRD Validation

Novel Master's `validate_nrd` tool checks for:
- Presence of all required sections
- Completeness of section content
- Structural integrity

**Validation Report Format:**
```json
{
  "complete": true/false,
  "missingSections": ["section1", "section2"],
  "recommendations": ["suggestion1", "suggestion2"],
  "sectionsFound": {
    "premise": true,
    "actStructure": true,
    "characterRoster": true,
    "povPlan": true,
    "worldRules": true,
    "themes": true
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific:** Vague NRDs produce vague story structures
2. **Include Examples:** Reference similar works or specific scenes
3. **Define Constraints:** Clear world rules prevent continuity issues
4. **Character Depth:** Even brief character descriptions should hint at arcs
5. **Act Clarity:** Each act should have clear beginning and end points
