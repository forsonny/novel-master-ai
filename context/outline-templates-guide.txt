- Plan emotional peaks and valleys

### 3. Define Scene Purpose
- Every scene should advance plot or character
- Cut scenes that don't serve story
- Combine scenes with similar purposes

### 4. Plan Pacing
- Vary scene length and intensity
- Balance action with reflection
- Build tension toward climax

### 5. Track Character Arcs
- Note character development in each chapter
- Plan arc milestones
- Ensure satisfying arc completion

### 6. Establish Stakes
- Define what's at risk
- Raise stakes throughout
- Resolve stakes at climax

## Using Outlines with Novel Master

### Step 1: Create NRD
Include your outline structure in the NRD's "Chapter-Level Beats" section.

### Step 2: Parse NRD
```
novel-master parse-prd .novelmaster/docs/nrd.txt --tag outline
```

This creates top-level tasks representing your chapters or major story beats.

### Step 3: Expand Chapters
```
novel-master expand --id 1 --num 5 --tag outline
```

This breaks chapters into scenes based on your scene-level breakdown.

### Step 4: Refine Structure
Use `update_task` to refine chapter purposes and scene breakdowns based on your outline.

### Step 5: Generate Manuscript
```
novel-master generate --tag draft
```

This creates chapter files with scene sections matching your outline structure.

## Outline Validation

Before parsing, ensure your outline:
- ✅ Has clear act structure
- ✅ Defines chapter purposes
- ✅ Includes scene breakdowns
- ✅ Tracks character arcs
- ✅ Plans pacing and tension
- ✅ Establishes stakes
- ✅ Defines emotional beats

## Common Outline Patterns

### Linear Chronological
- Simple timeline
- One POV
- Clear cause and effect

### Multiple Timeline
- Past and present
- Flashbacks
- Parallel storylines

### Multiple POV
- Different perspectives
- Converging storylines
- Character-specific arcs

### Episodic
- Standalone chapters
- Connected by theme
- Less linear plot

### Circular
- Story returns to beginning
- Changed perspective
- Full circle resolution

Choose the pattern that best serves your story, and structure your outline accordingly.
