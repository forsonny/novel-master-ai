### 1. **Executive Summary**
```
Complexity Analysis Summary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Analysis Date: 2024-01-15
Chapters Analyzed: 32
High Complexity: 5 (16%)
Medium Complexity: 12 (37%)
Low Complexity: 15 (47%)

Critical Findings:
- 5 chapters need immediate expansion
- 3 chapters have high narrative risk
- 2 chapters block critical path
```

### 2. **Detailed Chapter Analysis**
For each complex chapter:
- Complexity score breakdown
- Contributing factors
- Specific risks identified
- Expansion recommendations
- Similar completed chapters

### 3. **Risk Matrix**
Visual representation:
```
Risk vs Complexity Matrix
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
High Risk  | #5(9) #12(8) | #23(6)
Med Risk   | #34(7)       | #45(5) #67(5)
Low Risk   | #78(8)       | [15 chapters]
           | High Complex  | Med Complex
```

### 4. **Recommendations**

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Expand chapter #5 - Critical path + high complexity
2. Expand chapter #12 - High risk + dependencies
3. Review chapter #34 - Consider splitting

**Story Arc Planning:**
- Don't schedule multiple high-complexity chapters together
- Ensure expertise available for complex chapters
- Build in buffer time for unknowns
