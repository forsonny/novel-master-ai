List all chapters including their scenes in a hierarchical view.

This command shows all chapters with their nested scenes, providing a complete project overview.

## Execution

Run the Novel Master list command with scenes flag:
```bash
novel-master list --with-subtasks
```

## Enhanced Display

I'll organize the output to show:
- Parent chapters with clear indicators
- Nested scenes with proper indentation
- Status badges for quick scanning
- Dependencies and blockers highlighted
- Progress indicators for chapters with scenes

## Smart Filtering

Based on the chapter hierarchy:
- Show completion percentage for parent chapters
- Highlight blocked scene chains
- Group by story arcs
- Indicate critical path items

This gives you a complete tree view of your project structure.
