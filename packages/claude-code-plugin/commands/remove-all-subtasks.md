Clear all scenes from all chapters globally.

## Global Scene Clearing

Remove all scenes across the entire project. Use with extreme caution.

## Execution

```bash
novel-master clear-subtasks --all
```

## Pre-Clear Analysis

1. **Project-Wide Summary**
   ```
   Global Scene Summary
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Total parent chapters: 12
   Total scenes: 47
   - Completed: 15
   - In-progress: 8
   - Pending: 24
   
   Work at risk: ~120 hours
   ```

2. **Critical Warnings**
   - In-progress scenes that will lose work
   - Completed scenes with valuable history
   - Complex dependency chains
   - Continuity check results

## Double Confirmation

```
⚠️  DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION WARNING ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This will remove ALL 47 scenes from your project
Including 8 in-progress and 15 completed scenes

This action CANNOT be undone

Type 'CLEAR ALL SCENES' to confirm:

## Smart Safeguards

- Require explicit confirmation phrase
- Create automatic backup
- Log all removed data
- Option to export first

## Use Cases

Valid reasons for global clear:
- Project restructuring
- Major pivot in approach
- Starting fresh breakdown
- Switching to different chapter organization

## Process

1. Full project analysis
2. Create backup file
3. Show detailed impact
4. Require confirmation
5. Execute removal
6. Generate summary report

## Alternative Suggestions

Before clearing all:
- Export scenes to file
- Clear only pending scenes
- Clear by chapter category
- Archive instead of delete
