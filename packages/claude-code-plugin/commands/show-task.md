- "blocked" → Show all blocked chapters with reasons
- "critical" → Show critical story path chapters
- Multiple IDs → Comparative view

### 2. **Contextual Information**

For each chapter, intelligently include:

**Core Details**
- Full chapter information (id, title, description, details)
- Current status with history
- Continuity/pacing strategy and narrative criteria
- Priority and complexity analysis

**Relationships**
- Dependencies (what it needs)
- Dependents (what needs it)
- Parent/scene hierarchy
- Related chapters (similar work)

**Time Intelligence**
- Created/updated timestamps
- Time in current status
- Estimated vs actual time
- Historical completion patterns

### 3. **Visual Enhancements**
